stories are disappearing.

not because they aren’t told,
but because they aren't captured.

storeybox is a dedicated space.
four questions. four moments. four unique stories.

no feeds. no performance. no audience.
just stories, captured with care, and returned as a memory preserved forever.

because what we keep shapes who we become.
